[Live-Link](https://aravindont.github.io/sticky-navbar/) of the project

Here we will implement the sticky navbar i.e, when we scroll down after certain point also navbar will stick to the top.

## HTML

- Created the `index.html` file and added the `markup` code inside it

## CSS3

- Created the `styles.css` file to add the `styles` to the page using `CSS3`.

- Link the `styles.css` file with `index.html` file using the below `link tag`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```

## JavaScript

- Created the `index.js` file to add the funtionality to the code

- To link the `index.js` file and the `index.html` we need to use the `script tag`

```html
<script src="./index.js"></script>
```

- In this project our main aim is to make the poistion of navbar sticky and and after a certain point in the scrolling we will turn the background color of the `navbar` to `black` and text color to `white`.
